The main idea behind creating the project entitled Plan A Trip was to present an idea that how a little knowledge to frontend development
along with a good  knowledge of some major backend technologies like Node , Express and a database like Mongodb can result in an exciting
web site with  some advanced features. 
This was done in order to get a better understanding in the field of web development as a MEAN stack developer. The project revolves 
around some features of JS from exciting frontend animations with JS to writing server side code with NODE JS . The major highlights of
this project are authentication, authorization , body-parsing , Database connectivity , seeding, password resetting through Gmail with
async waterfall method , templating engines EJS, searching , basic comment system , Login and Logout , express sessions etc. 
In this a large number of  npm pacakages like flash , express , body-parser, method-override etc along with node.js library like
express.js has been used in order to code the website such that it results in an attractive , responsive and a beautiful project with
a single technology that is JS.
Though it lacks responsiveness in some sense.
